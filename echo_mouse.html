      <h2>Echo Mouse</h2>

        <p>Echo Mouse is a small utility I originally wrote to handle a repetitive task that required hundreds of identical mouse clicks. At the time, I searched for existing software to do this, but everything I found was paid-only. Out of equal parts practicality and stubbornness, I decided to write the functionality myself in Python.</p>

        <p>The first version was just a quick script that repeated the mouse actions I needed. After getting it working, I expanded it into something more general-purpose:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Record and replay sequences of mouse inputs (an “echo”).</li>
          <li>Adjust playback speed or set the sequence to repeat a fixed number of times—or infinitely.</li>
          <li>Save and load recorded sequences from simple “echo” files for reuse.</li>
          <li>Stop playback at any time just by moving the mouse, so unwanted clicks never pile up.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With a couple of days of extra work, I added a simple user interface and gave the project a proper name. The name Echo Mouse felt fitting, and it was partly inspired by the creature of the same name from The Owl House.</p>

        <p>I don’t expect Echo Mouse to compete with commercial tools, and I may be its only user, but I value it as the first piece of software I treated like a real project—structured, named, and packaged so others could use it if they wanted to.</p>
