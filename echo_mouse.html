      <h2>Echo Mouse</h2>

        <p>At some point I had a very repetitive task which required multiple mouse clicks and needed to be repeated hundreds of times. <!-- So that I can remember (or for anyone curious enough to look at the source of this page I guess) I was downloading images my mom wanted saved/backed up and she decided to send them over Facebook messenger for some reason and it didn't have the nice albums to download them at that point or she didn't use them. --> I thought to myself "There must be software that can do this, its so simple". At the time, at least, I could only find paid software which I took affront to, instead writing the python code to do it in a few minutes. To spite the paid software further I generalized the code to allow any input clicks to repeat and gave it a simple UI with a couple days of work. Of course I'm probably the only one who uses the software at the moment so I'm sure it hasn't hurt anyone's bottom line.</p>



        <p>It's basically the only software I've ever given a real name, but echo-mouse fits so well. Inspired by the creature of the same name from the show "The Owl House".</p>
