      <h2>Neural network quantum states</h2>

        <p>After my PhD I began my postdoc at Argonne National Laboratory where I began working on improving a new quantum many-body method which utilizes neural networks to learn the wave function of a specified system. In most systems of interest this is only possible utilizing custom neural network architectures which build in the fundamental symmetries of the system.</p>

        <p>When I joined the basic single gpu version of the codebase had just been implemented using the JAX library for Python. My contributions include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Execution across multiple GPUs and more recently utilization of multinode supercomputing. The code now efficiently scales to hundreds of GPUs on Argonne's Polaris supercomputer.</li>
          <li>Memory distributed optimization with our custom optimizer</li>
          <li>Implementation of better and more functional neural network architectures.</li>
          <li>Mathematical derivation of optimization methods compatible with wider variety of wavefunctions.</li>
          <li>Code refactoring and improved parameter inputs through configuration files to replace original hard-coded values.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Since joining I have become the primary developer of the main codebase branch and while I use the method for calculations within my field of nuclear theory, the codebase is much more general and has been utilized for calculations of chemical ground states as well.</p>
