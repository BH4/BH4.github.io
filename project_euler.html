      <h2>Project Euler</h2>

        <p><a href="https://projecteuler.net/" title="Project Euler">Project Euler</a> is a continually growing set of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems. I originally ran into Project Euler in high school around 2008 and used the introductory problems as a test of my programming ability. I eventually realized that these problems serve as an enormous repository for challenging problems to test my problem solving ability against and have continued to work to solve more problems over time. The type of problems hosted here aren't for everyone and I often have to take extended breaks myself, but I'm proud of my personal progress on the site. The below image shows the number of problems I've currently solved and is updated automatically.</p>
