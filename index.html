      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I've always been motivated by solving complex problems. A notable example would be teaching myself python in high school in order to solve the math puzzles on <a href="project_euler.html">Project Euler</a>.</p>

      <p>In college my main focus was my physics degree, however, I also took every computer science class which was of interest to me, which put me a bit beyond my computer science minor. I originally learned about machine learning in one of these classes around 2012 but at the time there was no one utilizing machine learning within the areas of physics I was interested in, but I worked on personal machine learning projects anyway, including testing some of the advancements in <a href="deep_reinforcment_learning.html">reinforcement learning</a>.</p>

      <p>In graduate school I resolved to combine my interest in physics and machine learning by attending a summer school at Los Alamos National Laboratory. This mostly involved training simple supervised learning physics emulators for condensed matter applications and investigating simulation results with unsupervised methods, but I was interested enough to make sure my postdoctoral research involved machine learning as much as possible. By this time scientific machine learning was much more common place and I found my current position working on <a href="NNQS.html">Neural network quantum states</a>.</p>

      <p>Many of my personal projects on github are mostly based around automation in some way. My favorite are simple utilities I've made to save myself time (and maybe others if anyone ever finds them). These include <a href="auto_arxiv.html">Auto Arxiv search</a> and <a href="echo_mouse.html">Echo Mouse</a>. Some of the older github projects I still have publicly available are coding competitions I participated in (most of which revolved around creating game playing agents) as well as investigations into things I found interesting in one way or another.</p>
