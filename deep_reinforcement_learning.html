      <h2>Deep reinforcement learning</h2>

        <p>Inspired by a DeepMind paper on a reinforcement learning agent that was able to play several Atari games, I went about implementing my own version.</p>

        <p>In this project, I designed and trained deep RL agents using Tensorflow. After testing the initial training algorithm with experience replay on some simple games I also worked over time to add additional improvements from the reinforcement learning literature, including using target networks and double deep q networks.</p>

        <p>As my first machine learing project outside of course work, this work deepened my expertise in neural network design, optimization, and data-driven experimentation. Skills I've utilized and continued to hone during my research career.</p>
