      <h2>Auto arXiv search</h2>

        <p>One of my more useful personal projects is a small tool I built to make it easier to keep up with new papers on the arXiv. I was frustrated with manually checking categories every day, so I wrote a script to filter and deliver only what I actually wanted to see.</p>

        <p>The project started as a basic keyword searcher, but I gradually added features to make it more useful:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Custom filtering by category, keywords, and authors.</li>

          <li>Daily or weekly email summaries of matching papers.</li>

          <li>Weighting paper importance through filtering so that the most relevant papers are shown first.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>What began as a quick utility turned into one of the most useful scripts I've written for myself. It saves time, reduces the noise of irrelevant papers, and makes it easier to keep up with topics I care about without falling behind. As an additional bonus I've found useful papers in categories I didn't used to check often using this tool.</p>

        <p>Like a lot of my projects, this grew out of a personal need but became a chance to practice building something more complete.</p>
