      <h2>Auto ArXiv search</h2>

        <p>Most of my personal projects have had to do with automation in some way and this is no exception. As I've progressed in physics the need to keep up with current advances in my field has increased, but the field has also become more niche. This means that I was spending at least an hour every day looking through the pre-print repository, ArXiv, just to find maybe one paper ever other week that was useful to me.</p>

        <p>There are really only a few criteria that a paper needed to satisfy for me to need to read it: the author is known to me and publishes in my field or the paper includes current keywords which mark it as a part of my field. At the time of writing this the second category was papers on nuclear physics which utilized machine learning in any way. Once I had my python code reading the new papers each day, using ArXiv's rss feed, these are easy enough to filter for. More difficult for me personally was getting the project to automatically send me an email with these papers. Ensuring the project remains authorized on the email account was new to me but a necessity. Now instead of spending an hour every day I get a weekly email summary for the papers I need to see.</p>

        <p>Since I've never tried to promote any of my personal projects, this is most likely the only one with more than one user. My wife found this a great idea as well and also utilizes it.</p>
